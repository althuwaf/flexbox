    <!--generally using the lang attribute to the above html tag is a good habit becauuse it helps the webpages out
    you can also specify the country as well. eventhough right now as im writing this i dont know why that
    would be useful. if in the future i find out why that is usefull i will update here. 
    now for example if you wanna specify the country as US then you can add that to the country in the following way.
    lang="en-US"-->

       <!--so this file is technically where we will be experimenting,working out and teaching myself different html,css 
       possibly javascript properties in the future.
       this is more like a documentation.after each action we will be explaining what it does and why did we do it
       and all sort of stuff like that.-->
       <!--the following line of code explains the style attribute that we can use in html to style our code
       below is a code with a style attribute of color red attached to it-->
    <p style="color:red">this is an example text in the color red</p>
    <!--now that i think about it i want to make this file the one stop destination with all the stuff i learn.
    this will be my personal notebook. i will update about new stuff i learn about in here.-->
    <!--the title attribute is another usefull one. what it does is that when you hover your mouse over this element
    it will give you extra information about what to do and all that. check out the following exmaple -->
    <p title="to download this file click on only the red download box. the rest are all ads">come here</p>
    <!--when adding headings did you know that you can actually specify the size of the headings?here we again use the html
    style attribute-->
